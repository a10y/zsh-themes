Custom ZSH Themes
=================

What's in here
---------------

The current collection:

* **aduffer**: It's like agnoster, but with more...me. Just some color changes
  actually, the rest is the same.
* **dropdown**: One I wrote from scratch, it's pretty much like every other
  two-liner, just with colors that I like.

Backburner (TODO's)
-------------------

* Add Git support to **dropdown**
* Possibly add tmux support, as an oh-my-zsh plugin (display the tmux screen and
  pane number, etc.)
